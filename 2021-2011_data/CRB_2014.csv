# Data-value qualification codes included in this output:
#  -997 Data may not provide a valid measure of conditions
#         If the current swe data value is > 0 and the Median is 0 then the percent of Median flag = -997
#         If either the current data value or the Median is missing then the percent of Median cell will be blank and the percent of Median flag will be -997
#         If the current swe value is < 10% of the Median peak swe then the percent of Median flag = -997
#         If over 1/2 of the stations for a basin report missing or invalid data then the percent of Median flag = -997
#  -998 No Normal available
#  -999 Missing data
#         If the current data value is missing then the current data value = -999
#         If the current precipitation is negative then the current precipitation value = -999
#         If the current swe is < -1 then the current swe value = -999
#         If over 1/2 of the stations for a basin are missing then the percent of Average cell is blank
#
# If the Basin Index (%) for comparison value is flagged as potentially invalid
# care should be taken to evaluate if the value is representative of conditions in the basin.
#
# The TOTAL PRECIPITATION percent of Average represents the total,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# precipitation (beginning October 1st) found at selected SNOTEL sites in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# or near the basin compared to the Average value for those sites on this day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Site -- Either: (a) the current value is missing; 
#(b) the median or average for the day is not available or is zero; or 
#(c) for snow water equivalent the median for the day is less than 10% of the maximum median value for  the year.
# Basin - More than half of the sites within the basin are flagged with * preventing the 
#calculation of a meaningful basin index.
The basin index is calculated as the sum of the valid current values 
divided by the sum of the corresponding medians (for snow water equivalent)
or averages (for precipitation) and the resulting fraction multiplied by 100.
