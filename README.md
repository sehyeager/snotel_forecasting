# Project-5: SNOTEL Water Level Analysis

## Problem Statement
The National Resources Conservation Service keeps track of precipitation levels in water basins across the Western United States using an automated system known as SNOTEL. This information is critical for resource management and provides insight on the climate status in the regions where the data is gathered. Understanding what areas may be experiencing abnormalities can be key  for planning resource management operations. Our goal is to determine if we can produce a model to predict precipitation levels in a water basin using data gathered from NRCS SNOTEL sites. 


----------------------------

## Background
#### SNOTEL
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) uses an automated system to collect snowpack and climate data in the Western United States known as SNOTEL (SNOwpack TELemetry). Growing from a manual measurement system SNOTEL has been reliably collecting data to produce water supply forecasts and support resource management activities since 1980. SNOTEL uses meteor burst communications to collect and communicate data in near real time without the use of satellites. There are more than 730 SNOTEL sites in 11 states, all designed to operate without maintenance for a year as they are typically in remote locations and maintenance trips can involve long hikes or helicopter trips. The NRCS National Water and Climate Center in Portland, Oregon houses the central computer that controls operation of the sites and receives the data gathered.

Our main focus was to look at the current reported precipitation level as well as the precipitation year to date for each site.

## Data
Data used contains data from SNOTEL sites in the Columbia River Basin on February 10th from the years 1990 - 2021.

SNOTEL Snow/Precipitation Update Reports were gathered [here](https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reports/SelectUpdateReport.html).

## Conclusions
Our models show that ARIMA models can be useful in predicting percipitation levels at SNOTEL sites. Our models were only tested for predictions on one day of the year, similar results should be seen when testing on other days of the year as well. We would recommend for further testing and use of the full data for every day of the year before implementing a model for short term predictions.
